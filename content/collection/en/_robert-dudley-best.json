Inspired by what he had seen, Robert began his studies of industrial design in Paris and D&uuml;sseldorf, where he became close friends with Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus movement. It was during this time that he made the first sketches of what would become the iconic Bestlite design. Although Robert had great expectations for the Bestlite, the first lamps did not quite end up where he expected.
