  "body": "<p>Although Jacobsen was first and foremost an architect, his legacy proves that he is more recognized for his furniture and other design works rather than his buildings. Product design came to him through his attention to details and need to design every aspect of his creations. When he was commissioned to design St. Catherine College, he ended up designing the interior and exterior furnishing, door handles, chairs, china, lamps and even the kind of fish for the pond. These finishing touches were in no way secondary to his buildings because they quickly took a life of their own, and have gone on to become a national and international heritage. Jacobsen was known to have collaborated with furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen for several years but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1951 that he made a breakthrough into furniture history with the Ant chair, originally designed for Novo pharmaceutical factory, and in 1955, the Series 7 chair. He also created the widely successful Egg chair and the Swan chair for the SAS Royal Hotel in 1958. Other designs include the Swan sofa, Series 3300 chairs, Tongue chair, Dot Stool Model 3170, Pot chair, Giraffe chair and more.</p>",
