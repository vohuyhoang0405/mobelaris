He was one of the leading figures of the cultural life of Denmark between the World Wars. His most valuable contribution to design was in the field of lighting. He carefully studied reflecting and baffling of the light rays from the bulb to achieve glare-free and uniform illumination. In 1925, one of these fixtures won first prize for modern lighting at the International Exposition of Decorative Arts in Paris. His light fixtures were manufactured by Louis Poulsen and his theories were still practiced by Louis Poulsen Lighting.
