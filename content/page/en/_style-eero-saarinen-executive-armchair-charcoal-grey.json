The Saarinen Executive Armchair was designed in 1950 for the \"Organic Design in Home Furnishings\" competition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Inspired by the dome-shaped glass wall of the Kresge Auditorium at MIT. The same shape will be seen at the back of this Executive Chair. With its fluid, sculptural form and modern finishing transformed the notion of what executive seating could be. Ideal for work, conference, lounge and dining set-up.",
