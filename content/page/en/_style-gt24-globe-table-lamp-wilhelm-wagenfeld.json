  "body": "The elegant design and quality craftsmanship of Wagenfeld's WG24 Style Table Lamp gives it a timeless aesthetic that works with any style interior. The lamp is a modernist celebration of function and form. The rounded shade is made from opalescent glass, which creates a glowing, diffused light. The stem is crafted from cylindrical stainless steel and is polished to reflect the light, while the base is a circle of thick glass. These geometric elements create a distinctive, effortless style reflecting the early modernist design principles. We recommend placing a pair of lamps either side of Josef Hoffmann's Kubus Sofa for a refined, atmospheric look.",
