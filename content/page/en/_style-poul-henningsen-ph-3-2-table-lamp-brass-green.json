  "body": "\r\nDesigned late in the 1920s, The Mobelaris PH 3/2 Style Table Lamp represent a highly decorative fixture series. Applying the unique three-shade system. Poul Henningsen designed lightning to permit 12% of the light generated to contribute to the overall lighting of a room, while the majority of illumination is focused outwards and downwards to cast an atmospheric yet effective glow. The shade design is based on a logarithmic spiral, with the centre of the light source placed in the spiral's focal point.",
