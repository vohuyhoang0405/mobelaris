  "body": "The original design of CH26 Chair was created by Hans J. Wegner in the 1950s, but it was never produced and no remaining mockups exist. Recent re-discovery of Wegner's original drawings finally brought this classic to life. Its organic shapes and exceptional craftsmanship made this chair a true Wegner masterpiece.\r\nSimilar to the other chairs of Wegner, the CH26 also features an ergonomically shaped seat and the characteristic sweeping shape of the armrests. Made for long, cosy evenings around the dining table, the CH26 is genuinely comfortable, durable, and classy.",
