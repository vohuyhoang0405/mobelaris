  "body": "\r\nIt was 1966 when Warren Platner came up with a stunning dining chair that brings mid-century modern elegance to any dining room decor. It gave way to the definition of &ldquo;a classic&rdquo; as something that, &ldquo;every time you look at it, you accept it as it is and see no way of improving it.&rdquo; Platner clearly knew his stuff, since he designed this chair, it has maintained its status as a design darling for nearly 60 years. Platner&rsquo;s design was the beginning of the &lsquo;decorative, gentle, graceful&rsquo; shapes in the design world.",
