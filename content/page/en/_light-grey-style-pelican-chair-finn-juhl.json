  "body": "\r\nOut of all the many designs of Finn Juhl, the Pelican Chair was probably the one furthest ahead of its time. This design was presented at the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers&rsquo; Guild Exhibition in 1940 and even more than 75 years after, this chair is still relevant in today&rsquo;s standard. An exquisite illustration of how Finn Juhl allowed art to influence his furniture designs. The curvaceous shape that ensures a high degree of comfort and its attractive and organic form is almost like a body holding a body. You are like sitting on a cloud with this chair.",
