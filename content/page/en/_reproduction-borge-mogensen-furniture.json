  "body": "<p>One of the most notable contributors among a generation of furniture designers. Mogensen garnered international respect coveting the concept of &ldquo;Danish Modern&rdquo; and making it known throughout the world. Born in Aalborg, Denmark, he started as a cabinetmaker in 1934. Studied at the Danish School of Arts and Crafts and focused on furniture design from 1936-1938. He then studied Architecture for three years at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts graduating in 1942. His craft was one of the favorites in one-man exhibitions in Zurich, London, New York, Paris, and Stockholm. His eye for design took him as far as his mastery of the contemporary lifestyle. His ideas correlate by size and proportion of objects surrounding it. Later on, his efforts took form as he developed a set of figures for the base width and depth of drawers and shelves making it an industry standard.</p>",
