He was able to create at least 180 different designs of lamps several of which have received international awards. All of his iconic design came from his training as a silversmith and his exposure to the work of designers such as Henning Koppel at Georg Jensen. Even after decades, his sought-after lamps are still in demand because of his great insight in elimination technique and a profound understanding of form, function and aesthetics.
