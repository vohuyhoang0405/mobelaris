  "title": "Erik Buch Bar Stool Dusty Rose",
  "body": "The organic and functional structure of Eric Buch&rsquo;s design characterised the true Danish design tradition, evident in Erik Buch Bar Stool from 1964. The use of solid maple wood creates a refreshing, organic look that's enhanced by distinctive grain patterns for natural artistry. A cushioned seat with lipped edges curves up just slightly to create a small lower back for optimal comfort and support while a footrest built into the base provides added support. This stool is a perfect addition to any international interior.",
