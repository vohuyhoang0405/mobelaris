  "body": "\r\nGrant Featherston came up with the idea to bend and join two pieces of plywood to form the shell of a chair sometime in 1950 while playing with a tram ticket and a year after that, the legendary Featherston Contour Chair was born. Featherston dreamed of making a chair that would be a &lsquo;negative&rsquo; of the human body to create the concept of &lsquo;contour comfort.&rsquo; Contour Chair was recognised worldwide as a post war breakthrough design. Fresh, contemporary design strikes ideal balance between classic comfort and updated style.",
