  "body": "\r\nWhile most designs from George Nelson were created using straight lines, the Bubble Lamp Criss Cross Ball is an exception, it was produced it 1952 by spinning a skeleton of steel wires on a turntable and shooting it with translucent plastic until it was covered in a smooth, washable film. &ldquo;When you put a light in it, it glowed.&rdquo; Thus the birth of the delicately designed lamp. Perfect for home, office, restaurant, bar and hospitality lighting settings, it adds a dash of warm glow without the glare effect.",
