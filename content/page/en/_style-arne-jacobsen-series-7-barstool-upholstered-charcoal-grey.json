  "body": "Originally designed circa 1955, the Arne Jacobsen, Series 7 chair, (Model 3107) is the epitome of mid-century Danish design, the design is created to give comfort and support whilst still remaining flexible, concave back and bottom section with slight winged edges. Celebrated globally as one of the bestselling dining chairs, Jacobsen inspired by Charles and Ray Eames&rsquo;s experimentation with bent plywood proved to design a true master piece.",
