  "body": "\r\nTransforming industrial wire rods into a new furniture form, Harry Bertoia was able to create a classic chair that symbolically represent the innovative design of the 50s. The industrial material and flowing form of the chair resembles a sculptural work of art; its delicate silhouette is deceptive, hiding the strength and stability of the construction. This chair looks great in offices, at home, in funky reception waiting areas. A modern Classic.",
