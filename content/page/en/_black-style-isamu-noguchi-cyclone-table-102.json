  "body": "\r\nThe design of the Noguchi Cyclone Table was first conceived by Noguchi in 1953 as a rocking stool of metal wire and wood for Knoll, the playful object evolved into a table that became a companion piece to the Bertoia wire children&rsquo;s chair. It was later changed to full size table at the suggestion of Hans Knoll in 1957. In combination with the chrome styled stainless steel bars, this coffee table will certainly be remarked as the eye-catcher in your living room.",
