  "body": "\r\nThe playful form and pop sensibility of Flowerpot VP2 Pendant Lamp capture the spirit of the sixties. Designed in 1968 and named after the Flower Power movement, Verner Panton was inspired by the generation of peace and love and continually collected new ideas on his tours through Europe. The ideas of freedom, modernity, and progress are clearly reflected in the design of the FlowerPot Big pendant lamp. A true design icon that has stood the test of time.",
