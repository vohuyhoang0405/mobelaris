  "title": "Eames Style Lounge Chair H Miller Version Premium Leather/Cream /Rosewood",
  "body": "Highly celebrated and recognised globally as the true mid-century classic lounge chair originally based on a traditional English club chair. Designed in 1956, the (670) lounge chair was original manufactured from 5-layer ply with real Brazilian rosewood veneer finish. Due to sustainabiliy issues the veneer was later (circa 1990's) changed to 7-layer ply and palisander rosewood (as per photo) which is more sustainable. Eames developed this chair to be mass produced and an affordable icon of modern style.",
