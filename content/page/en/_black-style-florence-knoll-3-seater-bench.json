  "body": "Designed to work with space rather than against it, the Knoll 2/3 Seater Bench characterised by the objective perfectionism of mid-20th century modern design and architecture. Initially designed by Florence Knoll for herself in 1954, As a part of a sofa range, two-seater, and a three-seater and armchair. Consistent with all of her designs, Florence Knoll's Bench has a sparse, geometric profile that reflects the rational design approach Florence learned from her mentor, Mies van der Rohe.",
