  "body": "\r\nThis Mart Stam Chair comes from a prototype&nbsp;Stam&nbsp;made for his wife around 1926. He used pieces of grey tubular steel, connected each other by &ldquo;L&rdquo; joints, normally used for natural gas pipes. The stability was guaranteed by a horizontal bar, which kept the legs rigid, eliminated in later reproductions. Stam&rsquo;s intention was to make a chair that was functional, modern, comfortable and, above all, lightweight and easy to move.",
