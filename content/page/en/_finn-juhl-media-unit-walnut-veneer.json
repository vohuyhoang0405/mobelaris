  "body": "The Style Finn Juhl Sideboard and Tray Unit, with its coloured sliding doors and trays was designed by Finn Juhl in 1955. With obvious cubist influence, the cabinet seems to float on a delicate steel frame which has wood feet. The colour elements reflected his fascination with Goethe&rsquo;s famous colour circle, which placed the colours in a harmonious cohesion.",
