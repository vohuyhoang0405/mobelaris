  "title": "PH 5 Pendant Lamp - Mini Shades of Grey",
  "body": "\r\nA lamp comprised of layers of aluminum in varying sizes, shapes and vibrant collurs that direct the light both vertically and horizontally, the Mobelaris PH 5 Pendant Lamp Mini was originally designed by Poul Henningsen in his ground-breaking PH Lamps series which started 1925. The fixture provides glare-free light. Its design is based on the principle of a reflective three-shade system, which directs majority of the light downwards. A warmer tone of light is created by the inside red cone and a small blue reflector. The finish not only contributes to the bold look of this lamp but helps reflect the light even more.",
