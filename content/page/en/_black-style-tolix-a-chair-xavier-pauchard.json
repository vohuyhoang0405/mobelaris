  "body": "\r\nOne of our most popular selling chairs. The Tolix A Chair known also as Marais A Chair, is designed in 1934 by the metalworker and functionalist Xavier Pauchard. They become increasingly popular as a part of domestic interior design and soon the different models found their place in factories, offices and hospitals, as well as outside, on caf&eacute; terraces and in public parks. This all-weather use chair is great for indoor and outdoor settings. For longevity, care should be taken to protect from long periods of wet weather.",
