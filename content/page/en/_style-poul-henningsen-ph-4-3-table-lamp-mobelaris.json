  "body": "The PH 4/3 Style Table Lamp by Mobelaris is a product of the three-shade system designed by the influential Danish designer, Poul Henningsen. Applying the unique three-shade system, Poul Henningsen designed lightning to permit 12% of the light generated to contribute to the overall lighting of a room, while the majority of illumination is focused outwards and downwards to cast an atmospheric yet effective glow. The shade design is based on a logarithmic spiral, with the centre of the light source placed in the spiral's focal point.",
