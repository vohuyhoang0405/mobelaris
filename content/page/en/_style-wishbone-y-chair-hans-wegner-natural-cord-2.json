  "body": "In 1949, Danish Designer Hans Wegner designed the Wishbone Chair, also known as the “Y” as a part of his Wagner series inspired by portraits of Danish merchants sitting in Chinese Ming Dynasty Chairs. Combining the top rails and arms into a single piece, Wegner took a giant leap in furniture design. Looking at the back of the chair, it resembles a breastbone of a chicken, commonly known as wishbone. With the semi-circular top rail and the curved hind legs, together with the elegantly shaped Y-back, the chair provides a welcoming air. A very ideal chair as it fulfills the functional demands for comfort and stability while having a distinct look.",
