A wooden dining chair with paper cord seat, it has been the best seller since it was released. Showcasing Wegner&rsquo;s unique style and insightful craftsmanship, the chair is unsurpassed for its comfort. It makes a practical fitting around the table even in small rooms because it has no armrest. Its simplicity of design is enhanced by superb details of construction.",
