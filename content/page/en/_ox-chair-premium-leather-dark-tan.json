  "body": "\r\nConsidered to be to be ahead of its time, the OX Chair designed by Hans Wegner in 1960 did not received the admiration it deserves until it came back to life in 1989. Be it in your home or in your office, never sacrifice comfortable durability for creative design and that is exactly what the OX chair is, comfortable in many different ways so you can change position continuously. The elegant design provides perfect mix of comfort and statement. Many thinks that Wegner was able to create the ultimate lounge chair with a sculptural heft that makes it a bit of a cliffhanger with this chair and who are we to differ?",
