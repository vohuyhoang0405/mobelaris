  "body": "\r\nWhen you hear the name Poul Henningsen, you think distinctive modern Danish lighting. The PH Snowball Lamp is designed in 1924 and stylishly suspended somewhere between his equally beloved and ubiquitous Artichoke and PH5 pendants. It is much about mathematics as it is about light. The shapes in this light are precisely aligned so that every surface receives a ray of light at exactly the same angle. Its geometry is designed to ensure all the illuminated surfaces of the shades are struck by the rays of light in the same angle, creating an even illumination.",
