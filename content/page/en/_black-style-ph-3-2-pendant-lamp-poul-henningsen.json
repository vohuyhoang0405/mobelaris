  "body": "\r\nPH 3/2 Pendant Lamp by Mobelaris inspired by Poul Henningsen design in 1927. The fixture is designed based on the principle of a reflective three-shade system, which directs the majority of the light downwards. The three glass shades of the PH 3/2 Pendant Light are arranged in a relationship of 3:2:1, drawing their reflections over a logarithmic spiral, which places the light source directly in the spiral&rsquo;s focal point. This beautiful pendant lamp is made of hand-blown white opal glass shades, which have been sandblasted on the undersides to create unique illumination.",
