  "body": "\r\nPart of the George Nelson Bubble Lamp Family designed in 1952 inspired by a hanging Swedish lamp in silk. The Bubble Lamp Pear is one of the designs Nelson has come up with after finding a much economically friendly version of the Swedish design. He then uses a resinous lacquer used by the military for protecting decommissioned ships and planes then spraying it over a wire care over a translucent plastic. The Bubble Lamp is featured in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.",
