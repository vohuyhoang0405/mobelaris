  "body": "<p>A Finnish architect and designer. His career has spanned from architecture, furniture, textiles, and glassware, as well as sculptures and paintings. From 1920's to 1970s, his work ranged from Nordic Classicism of the early work to a rational International Style Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. He adapted Gesamtkunstwerk (commonly known as Aesthetics) on to his work like no other together with his first wife, Aino Aalto.</p>\r\n<p>They not only built but gave particular attention and treatment all across his designs from interior surfaces and furniture design. His knack for furniture design is considered Scandinavian Modern. Working exceptionally well with wood bursting with simplicity and applying technical experimentation. This trait led him to receive patents for various manufacturing processes such as bent wood. One of his famous creations the Paimio chair uses this technique which was intended for tuberculosis patients. He also became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood. To this day, his &lsquo;High Stool&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stool E60&rsquo; are currently used in Apple Stores worldwide.</p>",
