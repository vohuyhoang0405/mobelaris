Originally designed by a world class architect and designer in 1956. Florence Knoll&rsquo;s relatively simple design was originally meant to complement the classic innovations of Saarinen and Bertoia. Knoll designed the classic trio using a durable stainless steel frame with minimal materials. Cubic cushions featuring compressed buttons in a purposeful and logical layout provide style and comfort to the supporting thin armed, minimalist frame.",
