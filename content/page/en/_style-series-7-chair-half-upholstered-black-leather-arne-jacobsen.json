  "body": "One of the most copied chairs of the modern era, it features an ideal shape for the human form, with a back that offers just the right amount of give to keep your upper body comfortable and a waterfall seat that supports your legs without pressing into them. Arne Jacobsen, instilled with a love of materials, shaped the core of Danish design identity with this chair by forming it from one piece of plywood that he cleverly narrowed in the middle to accommodate three different bends.",
