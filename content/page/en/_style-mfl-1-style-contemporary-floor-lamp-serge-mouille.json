  "body": "\r\nDesigned with the intention of supplying as much light as possible the MFL-1 Style Contemporary Floor Lamp was Serge Mouille&rsquo;s attempt to make the ordinary interesting again, by taking the tried-and-tested floor lamp design a complete aesthetic overhaul, bringing natural form into the living room. The sleek design dates back from 1953 and seems timeless as it is today. With its sleek iron body and curved, tapered legs, it was a radical design when it was first released to the public more than six decades ago.",
