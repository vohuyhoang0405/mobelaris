  "body": "<p>Isamu Noguchi, an American-Japanese sculptor and designer. One of 20th century&rsquo;s most important figure in the field. He is known for his architecture and furniture designs because of his unique style of integrating Japanese aesthetics with Western modernism. Noguchi was a mid-century designer known for his works that has challenged the boundaries of art and design. He gained acclaim when his biomorphic interlocking stone sculptures were included in &ldquo;14 Americans&rdquo; at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946. His extraordinary projects were now the subject of style furniture due to the inherent dichotomies in his works and many style furniture inspired by his designs are now available in the market. He designed numerous award-winning furniture like the noguchi sculpture, noguchi floor lamps and the well renowned noguchi coffee table to name a few. With more than six decades of brilliant career under his belt, Noguchi has left an amazing legacy.</p>",
