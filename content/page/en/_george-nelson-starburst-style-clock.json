  "body": "Get inspired by this Style Starburst Clock by George Nelson, one of the more than 150 clock designs . With the sculptural shape and the diversity of materials used, this design embodies the joie de vivre of the 1950s. Even after more than six decades, this clock remains a refreshing alternative to usual timekeepers that we are used to. Hang this clock on a wall and expect to be swept away on your feet because it will surely add a pop of atomic age in your wall.",
