  "body": "\r\nA lamp comprised of layers of aluminum in varying sizes, shapes and vibrant colours that direct the light both vertically and horizontally, the Mobelaris PH 3.5-3 Pendant Lamp was originally designed by Poul Henningsen in his ground-breaking PH Lamps series which started 1925. The fixture provides glare-free light. Its design is based on the principle of a reflective three-shade system, which directs majority of the light downwards. Warmer tones of light is created by the inside cones. The finish not only contributes to the bold look of this lamp but helps reflect the light even more.",
