  "body": "\r\nPoul Henningsen considers making an economical and glare free light an art. It must have been what he has in mind when he designed the PH 4.5 - 3.5 Floor Lamp Tall in the winter of 1925 for large exhibition hall in Copenhagen, Denmark called \"Forum\". The combination of diffused reflection and a logarithmic shade curve gave PH the opportunity to control a fixture's glare and shading, as each shade would evenly decrease the amount of light emitted according to their distance from the bulb. It is clean and contemporary and will look chic in any corner of your home.",
