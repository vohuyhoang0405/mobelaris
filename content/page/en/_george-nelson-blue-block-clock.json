  "body": "\r\nThe Blue Block Clock is a completely opposite approach to the thin vulnerable arms of the majority of wall timepieces. A 1947 classic, because of the popularity of the Ball, Turbine and Sunburst Clocks the Blue Block Clock did not really shine to stardom during that time. But now, Mobelaris wants to give it a share of the limelight as we introduce a premium style of the iconic clock in a more stunning and contemporary approach. The bold block style represents the strength and promise of the industrial age. Designed to fit any environment, this clock is one of George Nelson&rsquo;s most bold and recognizable creation.",
