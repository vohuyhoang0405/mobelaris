  "body": "In 1949, Danish Designer Hans Wegner designed the Wishbone Chair, also known as the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; or CH24 Chair as a part of his Wagner series. Inspired by portraits of Danish merchants sitting in the Chinese Ming Dynasty Chairs. HJW steam formed the top backrest into a single piece. Looking at the back of the chair, it resembles a breastbone of a chicken, commonly known as the wishbone. With the semi-circular top rail and the curved hind legs, together with the elegantly shaped Y-back, the chair provides a welcoming airiness. An ideal chair as it fulfils the functional demands for comfort and stability while having distinctive features.",
