  "body": "\r\nDesigned in 1950, the Asterisk Clock is one of the more than 150 clock designs by George Nelson. With the sculptural shape and the diversity of materials used, this design embodies the joie de vivre of the 1950s. Even after more than six decades, this clock remains a refreshing alternative to usual timekeepers that we are used to. Hang this clock on a wall and expect to be swept away on your feet because it will surely add a pop of atomic age in your wall.",
