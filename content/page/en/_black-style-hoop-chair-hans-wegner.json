Defined by its unique seat created from a round solid hardwood and a splay of woven rope that cradles the body when seating. The Hoop Chair is designed to go wherever you want it to go and match its surroundings no matter which room it ends up in tomorrow. The natural and simplistic design of Mobelaris high end style of the Hoop chair has a thick concave cushion placed over the seat while a small pillow supports your head for added comfort.",
