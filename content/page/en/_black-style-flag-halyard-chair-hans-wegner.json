  "body": "Flag Halyard Chair of Hans Wegner back in 1950. Although it hints a futuristic touch, it was surprisingly conceived during one holiday in Wegner&rsquo;s summerhouse. This one-of-a-kind armchair is made of solid stainless steel and it features a 240 meters specially developed flag line and a long-haired sheep skin made to make you enjoy the summer or a lazy afternoon in a more pleasurable way.\r\n",
