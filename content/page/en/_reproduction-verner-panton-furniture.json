Over the duration of his works, Panton introduced a number lighting designs tangential to other Scandinavian designs of the same era, Verner Panton lighting conflicted historic theories on how lighting should work, bouncing light off of color plates within the design giving off color nondirectional color variances.</p>\r\n<p>After working with Arne Jacobsen in the early 50&rsquo;s VP went onto opening up his own studio in 1950 and working on ideas such as a collapsible house (1955) During the end of the 50&rsquo;s, however, his chair design became much more nonconformist, with canter-liver designs and beautiful curvature.</p>\r\n<p>Panton was also one of the first designers to use single form injection molding to produce chair designs, therefore making the designers chair more commercially viable and allowing him to create the S chair which he became famous for, popular today as it was then, due to its organic shape and the color options available.</p>\r\n<p>During the late 1960&rsquo;s and early 70&rsquo;s Panton went onto commercial interior design projects, eccentric and colorful in design the applications were installed/displayed in hotels and exhibition centers.</p>",
