  "body": "\r\nIn the winter of 1925, Poul Henningsen developed a lamp family based on the principle of a reflecting multi-shade system, creating a harmonious and glare free illumination. The PH Wall Lamp provides a primarily downward illumination. Placed along a bed or couch, you can enjoy reading a good book under the PH wall lamp without the glaring light that other lamp has. The science applied on this lamp makes it a good choice for your home.",
