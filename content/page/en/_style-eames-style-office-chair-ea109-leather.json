  "body": "\r\nOriginally created in 1958 for outdoor and private residence use by the architects, Eero Saarinen and Alexander Girard but Charles Eames altered the materials to change the look and the feel of this chair. Eames Office Chair EA109 is one of the results of the Aluminum group and turned out to be the greatest furniture designs of the 20th century. Offering the same intelligent combination of materials as the rest of the group, the EA 109 is distinguished by a high back and armrests. It adapts to fit the body snugly and delivers great comfort. Perfect for executive boardrooms and home offices.",
