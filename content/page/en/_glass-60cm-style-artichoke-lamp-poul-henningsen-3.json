  "body": "Our style of the 1958 Artichoke Lamp by Poul Henningsen portrays the classic feel of the early 60&rsquo;s because of its luxurious design. Its sleek layers of leaf-like shapes handcrafted to perfection by Mobelaris has a mix of the mid-century vibe that maintains the original design. This inspired Artichoke lamp comes in colors of Aluminum, Copper, and White which elegantly lights up the room. Its surrounding leaf-like structure allows your light bulb to scatter light in a 360-degree angle without producing that bright glare.",
