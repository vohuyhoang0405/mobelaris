  "body": "\r\nA brilliantly simple design consists of only three elements, the glass top and two interlocking wood base pieces. The Noguchi Coffee Table was originally created in 1944. Widely considered to be the perfect combination of sculptural style and practical function, the imperial Table will uphold a variety of objects in a professional reception area or in the home. With a catalog of work spanning six decades, Isamu Noguchi drew inspiration from his Japanese father and American mother. As a designer and architect, his work is characterized as being influenced by both eastern and western cultures to create simple yet eye-catching designs.",
