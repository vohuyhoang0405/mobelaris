  "body": "Inspired by Poul Kj&aelig;rholm, this style piece of a mid-century design hopes to enact the very fibre of those &ldquo;casual conversations&rdquo; you so often crave with your family or friends. Bring them over for supper, and discuss any personal or professional matters here over this quality-made style of beautifu marble. And did we mention its rich history as a designer piece, dating back to the early 1950&rsquo;s?\r\nIt was, in fact, originally manufactured in Denmark; the first materials used to comprise it were of steel and stone. The very first prototype was originally designed for E. Kold Christensen, who first manufactured it. The first design period carried through from 1950 to 1959.",
