  "body": "\r\nChristian Dell created a lamp that tilts forward and back to three positions in 1931. The Kaiser Idell Floor Lamp is based on a world-patented swivel joint and the characteristic dome embossed with \"ORIGINAL KAISER-idell\". With the first part of the name being for the factory that produced it, the latter is an amalgam of Dell and idee, the German word for &ldquo;idea.&rdquo; The Kaiser Idell Floor Lamp by Mobelaris is also perfectly suitable as reading light.",
