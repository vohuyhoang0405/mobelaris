  "body": "\r\nin the 1960s, Warren Platner transformed steel wire into a sculptural furniture collection, creating a design icon of the modern era. The frame features wire rods that are perfectly bent to create the structure of a beautifully sculptured chair. The lounge chair has a fully upholstered shell, providing comfort while exposing the wire frame from the back side of the chair. A seat cushion and back cushion are built in to create a lovely lounging experience. A clear plastic extrusion ring creates a smooth bottom surface for the base.",
