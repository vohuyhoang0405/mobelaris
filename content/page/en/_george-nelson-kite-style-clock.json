  "body": "\r\nAs a writer, a designer, and a teacher, George Nelson's entire life was devoted to creating beautiful and interesting things and the Kite Clock is product of his imaginative and genius mind. Originally designed in 1960s, the diversity of materials used and their sculptural shapes they embody the 'joie de vivre' of the 1950s. It was designed with only 10 raised hour markers. Using color it represents both the dark and light sides of the industrial modern movement. The missing 6 and 12 hour positions are defined by the meeting in the middle of the light and dark. To this day, his wall clocks remain a refreshing alternative to the usual time-keepers.",
