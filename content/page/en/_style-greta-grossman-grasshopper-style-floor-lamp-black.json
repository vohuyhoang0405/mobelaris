  "body": "\r\n\r\nBreaking through gender barriers, Swedish architect and designer Greta Magnusson Grossman designed the Grasshopper Style Floor Lamp in 1948. The unique tripod stand of the Grasshopper Floor Lamp is tilted backward and gives the impression that the lamp is somehow alive and stalking its prey, a characteristic similar to the insect it was named after. Being one of Grossmanâ€™s most iconic designs, the authentic lamp has an elongated conical shade that directs the light downwards. A chic design that brings together the best of industrial inspired contemporary style and the best of sensuous yet minimalist mid-century modern pieces.",
