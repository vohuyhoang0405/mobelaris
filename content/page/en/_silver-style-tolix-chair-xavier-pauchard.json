  "body": "\r\nIt was Xavier Pauchard who created the legendary Tolix Chair in 1934. His discovery of galvanizing iron made it possible to prevent sheet metal rusting by dipping it into molten zinc. It has been a favourite of caf&eacute;s and retro kitchens all over the world meant to be outside in all weathers, which is why there are holes in the seats &ndash; to allow the rain to drain off and because of that it has been immediately popular that it became a part of the collections of the MoMA in New York in 2004.",
