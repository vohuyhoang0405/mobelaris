  "body": "\r\nIt began in 1946 as an experiment, the iconic DCW Chair by Charles Eames is now dubbed as the Best Design in 20th Century by Time Magazine in its 1999 millennial issue. Dining Chair Wood is a product of a wood-moulding techniques. A design classic that is built to last a long time, as the same moulded plywood technique used to create this beauty was the same one that created the aero plane wings during WWII. This uniquely shaped creation is much more than just good looks, it was designed to fit around the body so the body moves with the wood and not against it. A great addition to anyone&rsquo;s home.",
