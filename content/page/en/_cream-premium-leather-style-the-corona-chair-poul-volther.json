  "body": "\r\nLooking light but is actually as strong as spine, that best describes the Corona Chair and Corona Stool by Poul Volther designed after the wreath or corona that can be seen around the sun during a full solar eclipse. Poul M. Volther was inspired by the human anatomy when he designed Corona. Prior to the Corona Chair, Volther developed other, similar designs that included the Pyramid Chair in 1953: a foam and cloth constructed design which saw no commercial success. It is the now iconic Corona Chair for which he has become best known.",
