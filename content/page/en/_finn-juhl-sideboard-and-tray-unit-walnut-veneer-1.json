  "body": "The Style Finn Juhl Sideboard, with its coloured sliding doors and trays was designed by Finn Juhl in 1955. With obvious cubist influence, the cabinet seems to float on a delicate steel frame which has wood feet. The colour elements reflected his fascination with Goethe&rsquo;s famous colour circle, which placed the colours in a harmonious cohesion.",
