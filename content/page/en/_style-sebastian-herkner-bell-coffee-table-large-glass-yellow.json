  "title": "Bell Coffee Table - Large - Glass Yellow",
  "body": "This Mobelaris style of the Bell Coffee Table was inspired by Sebastian Herkner, a beautiful table with blown glass base in choice of colours. Herkner's original design was made in a traditional manner using wooden mould. The transparent tinted glass base asserts a sculptural presence in space, contrasting intriguingly with the solid brass frame on top while also forming a harmonious unit recalling the elegant curving silhouette of a bell.",
