  "body": "\r\n\r\nCapturing the mood of the post war era and Americaâ€™s emerging market, the Steering Wheel Clock was originally designed by George Nelson in 1961. Influenced by the motor car, the designer who were once stuck on a traffic got the idea from the steering wheel itself. This design has succeeded due to its sophistication and the elaborate design. This clock looks as striking and cutting edge now as it did when it was first conceived.",
