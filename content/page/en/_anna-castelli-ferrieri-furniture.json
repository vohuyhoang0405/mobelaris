  "body": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Anna Castelli Ferrieri was an Italian architect and industrial designer. She has established her influence in the use of polyurethane as a conventional design material. Graduating from Milan Polytechnic Institute with a degree in architecture in 1943 she spearheaded and co-founded Kartell, an Italian leading edge furniture company. Through her use of plastics, a fairly unusual furniture material at the time, she was able to craft novel forms that were both exquisite and functional. <br /><br />Her best-known work is the Componibili. This idea gave birth to stacking module storage pieces we now know today. These units were described as &ldquo;Flexible, functional and practical&rdquo; and as &ldquo;instantly endearing and slightly futuristic that suits any space with ease&rdquo; Today, even after 40 years of production, the Componibili is still one of the Kartell&rsquo;s best-selling furniture items.&nbsp;</p>",
