Designed in 1958 when Arne Jacobsen was asked to design the lobby and the reception area of the exclusive Royal Hotel in Copenhagen. In that perfect opportunity, Jacobsen put his theories of architecture and integrated design into practice and the iconic Egg chair and Stool were one of the biggest success in his design and it quickly became a Mid Century Classic.&nbsp;",
