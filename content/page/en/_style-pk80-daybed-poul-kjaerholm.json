  "body": "\r\nPoul Kjaerholm designed the PK80 Daybed in 1957 and is widely considered as one of his most sophisticated works of this period. Drawing inspiration from Bauhaus, which in turn, were inspired by ancient Roman couches. Its striking proportions, the elegance of its materials and construction, and the beauty of the large welted leather mattress all come together to produce an iconic work and one of Kjaerholm's finest creations. Its popularity earned its place from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to lounges and waiting areas and private homes.",
