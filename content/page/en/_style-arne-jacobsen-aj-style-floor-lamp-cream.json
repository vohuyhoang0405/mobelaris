  "body": "When the Radisson SAS Royal Hotel in Copenhagen was inaugurated in 1960, the Danish design icon Arne Jacobsen designed the AJ Lamp together with The Egg and The Swan Chair to echo the oblique angles of his Series 3300 furniture. Its uniquely asymmetrical swiveling shade has caught many attentions because of the design and the way light was distributed properly. The characteristic opening of the luminaire contributes to the elegance and weightlessness of the design. The shade rotates 60 degrees to either side. A very functional and elegant piece must-have.",
