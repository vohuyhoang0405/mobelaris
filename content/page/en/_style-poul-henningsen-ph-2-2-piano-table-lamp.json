  "body": "\r\nThe Mobelaris style of PH 2-2 Piano Table Lamp represent a highly decorative fixture series. Originally designed by Poul Henningsen, the PH 2-2 Piano Table lamp emit a soft and comfortable diffused light. Applying the unique three-shade system, Poul Henningsen designed lightning to permit 12% of the light generated to contribute to the overall lighting of a room, while the majority of illumination is focused outwards and downwards to cast an atmospheric yet effective glow. The shade design is based on a logarithmic spiral, with the centre of the light source placed in the spiral's focal point. ",
