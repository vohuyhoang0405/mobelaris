  "body": "\r\nBefore discos were invented, Verner Panton was ahead of his time as he was able to design a disco ball looking lamp in Topan VP6 Pendant Lamp. Originally designed for the hotel and restaurant Astoria in Trondheim, Norway, in 1960. Being the first mass produced lamp by Panton, it was later followed by the iconic Flowerpot light but it was at the same time his most memorable design. The pendant is as modern today as it was then.",
