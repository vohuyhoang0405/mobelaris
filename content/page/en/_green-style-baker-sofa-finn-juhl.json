  "body": "\r\nIn 1959 Finn Juhl brought international recognition to Danish design with his U.S. debut in the \"Good Design\" exhibit in Chicago and at MoMA in New York and in that same year, the Baker Sofa was created. It was originally designed for Baker Furniture Inc. in USA. Juhl was very much interested by modern free art, thus the inspiration for the iconic design. He used two-piece curved back that embraces the sitter whilst highlighting the sofa's visual lightness. The sofa is suitable for daily use in the home or workplace because of the three generous dimensions that allows two to three people to sit comfortably.",
