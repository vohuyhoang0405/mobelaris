  "body": "\r\nConsisting of a distinct, fully tufted, seat and back covering attached to an exposed metal or wood frame and legs, the Knoll Corner Sofa was designed by Florence Knoll in 1954. Planning with her belief in \"total design\" - embracing all aspects of design principles which were radical departures from the standard practices in 1950s, but were quickly adopted and remain widely used today.
