  "body": "\r\nA flawless lamp in every aspect, the PH 3.5/2.5 Style floor lamp by Poul Henningsen is truly a masterpiece in the history of modern lighting design. Designed in 1925 for an exhibition in Paris. He was the first person to pursue a scientific approach to light and use the logarithmic spiral as a basis. By using a design based on the logarithmic spiral he achieved even distribution of light over the entire curve of the shade. All handblown opal glass shades are sandblasted on the undersides for uniform light distribution.",
