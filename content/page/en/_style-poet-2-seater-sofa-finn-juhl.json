  "body": "\r\nFinn Juhl created a small sofa for his house in Charlottenlund, a rural area north of Copenhagen. But it was only until 1959 when the chair received its name when a Danish cartoonist described the exact sofa as the place where a young poet would withdraw to contemplate the complexities of life. Thus, the birth of the name The Poet Sofa. Designed with refined aesthetics and organic form, this sofa is one of his most popular and versatile design. Depicting comfort and elegance, it brings a luxurious and relaxed feel to any environment. The upholstery is very slim compared to the norm at the time and it was the result of Finn Juhl&rsquo;s ambition to create functional furniture for smaller apartments.",
