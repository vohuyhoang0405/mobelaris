  "body": "\r\nA favorite of many interior designers and furniture fans alike, the Knoll Armchair showcases Florence Knoll&rsquo;s clean, linear designs work superbly in any environment. Designed in 1954, this chair is a scaled-down translation of the rhythm and proportions of mid-century modern architecture. Learning from her mentor, Mies van der Rohe, Knoll expresses rational design approach by creating a spare geometrical profile in this utterly modern and totally timeless chair. This minimalist yet elegant style Knoll Armchair by Mobelaris is supremely comfortable and is a versatile design that would suit both the home or office environment.",
