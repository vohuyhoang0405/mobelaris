  "body": "\r\n\r\nBernard Schottlander created the Mantis series of lamps in 1951.&nbsp;Designed with the intention of supplying as much light as possible, the Mobelaris style Mantis BS1L Floor Lamp was Schottlander&rsquo;s attempt to make the ordinary interesting again, by taking the tried-and-tested floor lamp design a complete aesthetic overhaul, bringing natural form into the living room. His clever system of counterweights combined with a system of strong and flexible metal poles, makes the Mantis Lamps look like they're defying gravity.",
