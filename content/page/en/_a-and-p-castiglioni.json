  "body": "<p>Achille 1918-2002 (Italy) - Pier Giacomo 1913-1968 (Italy) Since 1940, Archille had dedicated himself to experimenting on industrial products with his brothers Livio (1911-1979) and Pier Giacomo. They focused on Urban Planning, Architecture and Design and worked towards developing a process of integral design. This meant considering how each component within the process would work in conjunction with one another, from the materials through to production. &ldquo;There has to be irony, both in design and in the objects. I see around me a professional disease of taking everything too seriously. One of my secrets is to joke all the time.&rdquo;</p>",
