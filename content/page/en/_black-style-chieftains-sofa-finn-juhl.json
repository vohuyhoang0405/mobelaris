  "body": "\r\nFinn Juhl created the Chieftains Sofa for the 1949 Cabinetmakers&rsquo; Guild in Copenhagen. It is one of Finn Juhl's absolute masterpieces designed at the peak of his career. With seats that appears suspended above the frame and distinctive shapes inspired by primitive weaponry the sculptural form of the Chieftains Chair changed the future of Danish design. It was in this design that it was reported that when King Frederick IX sat in the chair during the exhibition the name was produced. This particular sofa is still a part of the permanent exhibition of Modern Danish Furniture.",
