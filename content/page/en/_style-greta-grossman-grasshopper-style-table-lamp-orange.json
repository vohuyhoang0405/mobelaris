  "body": "\r\nBeing one of the first females to graduate from the famous Stockholm Konstfak School of industrial design, Gretta Grossman designed the iconic Grasshopper Style Table Lamp in 1947 as part of the Grasshopper series. The high influence of European modernism shows through her designs. This lamp clearly defines the mid-century modern style that emerged out of California at that time. It's sleek and has many features that other competing products overlook.",
